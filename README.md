# 📊 Comparison of RNN vs LSTM vs GRU on IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis

## 🧠 Project Description

This project presents a comprehensive **comparison of RNN, LSTM, and GRU** architectures for **sentiment analysis** on the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**. The aim is to evaluate how these different recurrent models perform in terms of **accuracy**, **training time**, and **efficiency** when applied to natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Each model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras with a standardized preprocessing pipeline including **tokenization**, **padding**, and **embedding layers**. The results are visualized using **matplotlib** to highlight performance trade-offs.
